# Bootcamp
Pro Dev docs for the Deep Dive Coding Bootcampâ€”Digital Media

I've been a freelancer all my life, except for about four years in the late '90s when I first moved to New Mexico and worked at an advertising agency, and I'd like to continue and grow my freelance business -- BUT I've been totally broke enough lately to realize the strengths of gainful employment. So I'd like to pursue a path that is open to both possibilities, and to do that I think I need to focus more on the employment side, since that's the one I know the least, and have the last experience, in.


My Personal Notes for the previous week:

What did I learn last week? (Last several weeks, really, since this is my first entry.) Well, I've learned how to create animated commercials with Vyond -- and I learned that coffee shops either don't have any marketing budget, or just won't return your messages. Bad choice of industry there! I also learned animation with Adobe Animate, and game design and construction with Stencyl, Scratch and Unity. More important, I learned that I'm not all that interested in game design -- but I also learned that I still really love animating, and I'm very glad I'm learning how to do it digitally!


My Personal Notes for previous week (June 17-21):

I spent most of the week working on my personal animation project, hoping to have it complete or at least mostly complete for the entrepreneur event on Thursday, though I never got an opportunity to show my progress when I was there. I also worked with my team on our baby sign language project, but they both have difficult personal situations right now and we didn't get much done there either. 

I worked the camera for Isaiah's green screen project and it helped inspire me for what I'll do for my green screen project this week. 

I also had a lot of professional work I needed to attend to, which took up more time than I'd like. This week it looks like there will be a lot less of that, for good or bad. 

And on Friday I had some family-related difficulties of my own which kept me from the Pro Dev workshop. Fortunately things are much better there now.

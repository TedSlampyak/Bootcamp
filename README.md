# Bootcamp
Pro Dev docs for the Deep Dive Coding Bootcampâ€”Digital Media

I've been a freelancer all my life, except for about four years in the late '90s when I first moved to New Mexico and worked at an advertising agency, and I'd like to continue and grow my freelance business -- BUT I've been totally broke enough lately to realize the strengths of gainful employment. So I'd like to pursue a path that is open to both possibilities, and to do that I think I need to focus more on the employment side, since that's the one I know the least, and have the last experience, in.


My Personal Notes for the previous week:

What did I learn last week? (Last several weeks, really, since this is my first entry.) Well, I've learned how to create animated commercials with Vyond -- and I learned that coffee shops either don't have any marketing budget, or just won't return your messages. Bad choice of industry there! I also learned animation with Adobe Animate, and game design and construction with Stencyl, Scratch and Unity. More important, I learned that I'm not all that interested in game design -- but I also learned that I still really love animating, and I'm very glad I'm learning how to do it digitally!
